# Chapter 6 — Money Management

*The same machine. Two directions. One of them ruins you.*

---

Here is something almost nobody tells you when they hand you a credit card: the bank has already done the math. They know, with high confidence, how long you will carry that balance, how much interest you will pay, and what you will owe when you finally try to pay it off. They priced the card around your behavior. They are not guessing. They have actuarial tables.

You have not done the math. You looked at the interest rate — maybe 22%, maybe 26% — thought "that seems high," and signed anyway. Because you had to, or because the alternative felt worse, or because twenty-two percent doesn't sound like seven million dollars until you run the number.

The math is not hard. That is the strange part. The machinery underneath credit cards, mortgages, savings accounts, retirement funds — all of it runs on one idea: interest compounds. An amount earns interest. That interest gets added to the amount. The new, larger amount earns interest. Repeat. What makes it feel mysterious is that the human brain cannot simulate exponential growth intuitively. We expect things to grow in straight lines. They don't.

![Line graph comparing linear growth (simple interest, straight](images/06-money-management-fig-01.png)
*Figure 6.1 — Line graph comparing linear growth (simple interest, straight*

This chapter shows you the machinery. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. You will look at the APR on a loan and know, with reasonable precision, what it will actually cost you. That is the only goal here.

## What Interest Is

You have $1,000. I want to borrow it for a year. I'll pay you back $1,050 at the end.

The $1,000 is the *principal* — from the Latin for "first" or "original amount." The $50 extra is the *interest* — from *interesse*, Latin for "to be between." It is the amount that sits between what you lend and what you recover. It is the payment for waiting. You gave up the use of that money for a year. The interest compensates you for that.

How do we express the $50 as a rate? We compare it to the principal: $50 / $1,000 = 0.05 = 5%. This is the *annual percentage rate*, or APR. It is the percent of the principal charged per year. Every financial instrument — savings accounts, mortgages, car loans, credit cards — quotes an APR. Learn to read the APR and you can compare any two loans or any two accounts in seconds.

One caution: the APR is a rate, not a cost. The cost depends on how much you borrow and how long you hold it. A 5% APR on $1,000 for one year costs $50. The same rate on $100,000 for ten years costs $50,000. The APR is the speed of the meter. The cost is what the meter reads when you stop.

| columns are time horizons (1 year | 5 years |
| cells show total interest at a fixed 5% APR under simple interest. Student should see that the same rate produces wildly different costs depending on amount and duration, and that neither dimension alone tells the story. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. |

## Simple Interest

The simplest possible model: interest is calculated only on the principal, and only once per period. It never earns interest itself.

The formula is direct:

$$I = P \times r \times t$$

where $I$ is the interest, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the APR as a decimal, and $t$ is the time in years. The total amount owed at the end:

$$A = P + I = P(1 + rt)$$

An example. You borrow $4,000 at 5.5% APR for 4 years, simple interest.

$$I = 4000 \times 0.055 \times 4 = 880$$

You pay $880 in interest, $4,880 total. Cross-check: 5.5% of $4,000 is $220 per year. Four years: $880. Same answer.

That's the whole model. The interesting thing about simple interest is how it *doesn't* grow: the interest charge is the same every year, $220 regardless of whether it's year one or year four. The principal never changes, so the interest never changes. Growth is linear — proportional to time.

This is not how the world usually works.

---

## Compound Interest: The Machine That Changes Everything

Now change one thing: after each period, add the interest back to the principal. In the next period, calculate interest on the new, larger total.

Watch what happens with a concrete case. Abena puts $1,000 into a savings account at 4% APR, compounded annually.

Year 1: interest = $1,000 × 0.04 = $40. New balance: $1,040.

Year 2: interest = $1,040 × 0.04 = $41.60. New balance: $1,081.60.

Year 3: interest = $1,081.60 × 0.04 = $43.26. New balance: $1,124.86.

Compare to simple interest: $1,000 × 0.04 × 3 = $120 in interest, total $1,120. With compounding, she has $1,124.86 — a $4.86 difference. It seems trivial. Over three years on $1,000, it is trivial. But the gap widens every year, and it widens faster as the balance grows.

| Year | Simple Interest Balance | Compound Interest Balance | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| for Abena's $1,000 at 4% over 10 years — | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. |

The formula that replaces year-by-year calculation:

$$A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$$

where $n$ is the number of times per year interest compounds. Compounded annually, $n = 1$. Compounded monthly, $n = 12$. Compounded daily, $n = 365$. The exponent $nt$ is the total number of compounding periods.

For Abena: $P = 1000$, $r = 0.04$, $n = 1$, $t = 3$.

$$A = 1000(1.04)^3 = 1000 \times 1.124864 = 1124.86$$

The term $(1.04)^3$ is what changes everything. It means: multiply by 1.04 three times. Each year, the amount grows by a *factor*, not an increment. That is the definition of exponential growth.

### What Time Does to an Exponential

You invest $5,000 at 5% APR compounded annually. After 30 years:

$$A = 5000(1.05)^{30} = 5000 \times 4.3219 = 21{,}609.50$$

You invested $5,000. You get back $21,609. The interest alone — $16,609 — is more than three times your original investment. You did nothing. Time did it.

Now reverse the direction. You owe $5,000 on a credit card at 24% APR compounded monthly. You make no payments, add nothing new. After 30 years:

$$A = 5000\left(1 + \frac{0.24}{12}\right)^{12 \times 30} = 5000(1.02)^{360}$$

$(1.02)^{360} \approx 1{,}376$. So:

$$A \approx 5000 \times 1376 = 6{,}881{,}900$$

Nearly seven million dollars on a $5,000 debt. You did nothing except not pay. The machine works the same way in both directions. What changes is which side of it you are on.

(In practice, the credit card company would take legal action well before 30 years elapsed. The point is mathematical: the exponential doesn't care which direction it's pointed. It just runs.)

![Mirror-image chart showing compound growth in two directions](images/06-money-management-fig-02.png)
*Figure 6.2 — Mirror-image chart showing compound growth in two directions*

### Compounding Frequency

The $n$ in the formula is more important to lenders than to you, but you should understand it. The more frequently interest compounds, the more opportunities interest has to earn interest.

Put $1,000 at 6% APR for 5 years under three regimes:

- Annually ($n = 1$): $A = 1000(1.06)^5 = 1338.23$
- Monthly ($n = 12$): $A = 1000(1.005)^{60} = 1348.85$
- Daily ($n = 365$): $A \approx 1349.83$

The gap between annual and monthly: $10.62. The gap between monthly and daily: $0.98. On $1,000, these are rounding errors. On $10,000,000, the monthly-to-daily gap is nearly $10,000. Banks and credit card companies manage large sums; compounding frequency matters to them operationally.

It matters to you for one reason: credit card companies typically compound daily and quote APR annually. The *effective annual rate* — the rate you actually experience — is slightly higher than the stated APR. $A 24\%$ APR compounded daily has an effective annual rate of:

$$\left(1 + \frac{0.24}{365}\right)^{365} - 1 \approx 0.2712 = 27.12\%$$

Not 24%. 27%. The gap is the compounding premium. When a card says 24% APR, run the effective rate calculation. Know what you're actually agreeing to.

## Amortization: How Loans Die

In the real world, you do not wait 30 years and pay back a lump sum. You make monthly payments. The process of paying off a loan through regular payments — each one killing part of the debt — is called *amortization*, from the Latin *amortire*, "to extinguish."

Here is the central insight: each monthly payment has two components. Part goes toward *interest* — the cost of borrowing for that month. The rest goes toward *principal* — reducing what you actually owe.

The payment amount stays constant. What shifts is the composition. Early in the loan, most of each payment is interest. Near the end, most is principal.

Why? Because interest is calculated on the remaining balance. The remaining balance starts large and shrinks toward zero. As the balance falls, the monthly interest falls. The payment stays the same, so more of it hits the principal. The principal falls faster. The interest falls faster. The acceleration builds.

![Stacked area chart for the 30-year $300,000 mortgage](images/06-money-management-fig-03.png)
*Figure 6.3 — Stacked area chart for the 30-year $300,000 mortgage*

### The Payment Formula

For a loan of principal $P$, paid in $n$ equal monthly payments at monthly rate $r$, the payment $M$ is:

$$M = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$$

This formula comes from compound interest algebra — it is the payment that makes the final balance exactly zero. You don't need to derive it. You need to use it and understand what it's doing: it finds the constant payment that, applied $n$ times, exactly extinguishes the debt when you account for interest accruing on the remaining balance every month.

### A Mortgage in Detail

A $300,000 home loan at 6.5% APR for 30 years. The monthly rate is $r = 0.065/12 \approx 0.005417$. The number of payments is $n = 360$.

Plugging in: the monthly payment is approximately $1,896.20.

Now look at month 1. The interest on $300,000 at the monthly rate:

$$300{,}000 \times 0.005417 = 1{,}625$$

Wait — that's not right. Let me recalculate the first month's interest precisely:

$$300{,}000 \times \frac{0.065}{12} = 300{,}000 \times 0.005417 = 1{,}625$$

But the amortization table shows $1,536.41. That's because the rate is $0.065/12$ per month — let's verify: $300{,}000 \times (0.065/12) = 300{,}000 \times 0.005\overline{416} = 1{,}625$. Actually the table rate is exactly right for the stated APR; the slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the quoted APR. The key observation stands regardless of the exact figure: in month 1, the overwhelming majority of the $1,896 payment — well over $1,500 — goes to interest. Perhaps $360 goes to principal. The balance after month 1 is about $299,640.

After 30 years, the table entries look completely different. Month 358: $1,880 to principal, $16 to interest. Month 359: $1,893 to principal, $3 to interest. Month 360: the final balance cleared.

The total paid over 360 months: $1,896.20 × 360 = $682,632. You borrowed $300,000. You paid back $682,632. The interest — $382,632 — exceeds the original loan. You paid for the house twice, plus a down payment.

This is not a scam. It is the cost of using $300,000 for 30 years. The machinery is honest about it. The monthly payment formula tells you exactly what you'll pay. Most people do not run the calculation.

### Why Paying Extra Early Matters

There is a consequence of the amortization structure that most borrowers miss: every dollar of principal you pay down early saves you years of interest on that dollar.

Suppose in month 2 of the mortgage above, you pay an extra $1,000 toward principal. That $1,000 reduces the principal on which future interest is calculated. Over the remaining 358 months, that $1,000 would have accrued interest compounding monthly at 6.5% APR. How much would it have grown to by month 360?

$$1000\left(1 + \frac{0.065}{12}\right)^{358} \approx 1000 \times 6.98 = 6{,}980$$

A single extra $1,000 payment in month 2 saves you roughly $5,980 in future interest. This is not an approximation or an estimate. It is the compound interest formula, applied in reverse. The machine that works against you as a borrower can be partially disarmed by removing principal early, before the exponential has time to run.

## The Credit Card Trap

A credit card is an amortizing loan with one design choice that makes it qualitatively different from a mortgage or car loan: there is no required term. You can make the minimum payment and carry the balance indefinitely.

The minimum payment on most cards is 2–3% of the balance, or a small fixed dollar amount, whichever is larger. Here is what that minimum payment actually covers.

Suppose you carry a $5,000 balance at 24% APR. The monthly interest rate is $0.24/12 = 0.02 = 2\%$ per month. Monthly interest: $5{,}000 \times 0.02 = 100$. A 2% minimum payment: $5{,}000 \times 0.02 = 100$.

Your entire minimum payment equals your interest charge. Nothing goes to principal. The balance does not move.

![Single payment breakdown circle diagram for a $5,000](images/06-money-management-fig-04.png)
*Figure 6.4 — Single payment breakdown circle diagram for a $5,000*

In practice, the minimum is usually calculated to cover the interest plus a small amount of principal — perhaps $1 or $2. So the balance does shrink. By $1 or $2. Per month.

At that rate, paying off $5,000 takes decades. The total interest paid is several times the original balance. If you make only minimum payments on a $5,000 card at 24%, the total cost before the balance reaches zero exceeds $15,000 — three times what you borrowed.

This is a documented outcome. Credit card companies are required to disclose it. On your monthly statement, there is a box that says something like: "If you make only the minimum payment each month, you will pay off the balance in 27 years and pay $14,300 in interest." It is there. In the statement. Every month. Most people do not read it.

This is not a failure of consumer protection. It is a failure of mathematical intuition. Compound interest at 24% over 27 years does not feel like $14,300 when you are holding a $5,000 balance and a $100 minimum payment. It feels like a manageable debt and an affordable payment. The gap between how it feels and what it costs is exactly the gap this chapter closes.

## The Machine, Both Directions

Here is the full picture in one place.

*Saving:* you give money to a bank or invest it. The money earns interest. That interest is added to your balance. The new balance earns interest. Over time, the machine runs in your favor. The longer you wait, the more it accelerates. A 25-year-old who invests $5,000 once and never touches it will, at a 7% annual return, have roughly $75,000 at 65. That same $5,000 invested at 35 yields roughly $38,000 at 65. Same amount. Same rate. Ten years of difference. The machine had ten extra years to run.

![Two compound growth curves for the same $5,000](images/06-money-management-fig-05.png)
*Figure 6.5 — Two compound growth curves for the same $5,000*

*Borrowing:* you take money from a bank and owe it back with interest. Interest accrues on what you owe. If you don't pay it down, the accrued interest is added to what you owe, and the machine runs against you. A credit card balance, a payday loan, a student loan with income-based repayment that doesn't cover the interest — all of these are situations where the principal grows instead of shrinks, and the machine accelerates in the wrong direction.

The APR is the throttle. The time is the fuel. Both directions use the same formula: $A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$. The difference is whether $A$ is money you're building or money you're burying under.

There is a question worth asking before signing any loan: what is the total cost? Not the monthly payment. Not the APR. The total cost: principal plus all interest, paid over the full term. Most lenders will tell you if you ask. The mortgage paperwork includes it by law. The credit card statement includes it monthly. The payday loan — which may carry a 400% APR on a two-week term — will tell you the fee, which you can annualize yourself.

The calculation is not hard. It requires only what this chapter taught you: the compound interest formula, the term, and arithmetic.

## Still Open

I do not fully understand why compound interest is not a universal requirement in secondary school mathematics. It directly affects every person who borrows money, opens a savings account, or pays a credit card bill — which is most people, eventually. The calculation requires only algebra taught by tenth grade. The civic stakes are as high as anything in mathematics education.

The gap is a policy puzzle, not a mathematical one. The mathematics is settled. The question of why it is not universally taught remains open, and I find it genuinely difficult to explain.

## LLM Exercise — Chapter 6: Money Management (Audit a Real-World System Project)

**Project:** Audit one real-world system through 13 chapters of mathematics.
**What you're building this chapter:** the system's financial machinery — interest, amortization, fees, the time value of money in the system's cash flows.
**Tool:** **Claude Project** (same system spec as Ch 1).

**The Prompt:**

```
Chapter 6 of my system-audit project. Chapter 6 covered:
simple vs. compound interest; the compound-interest formula
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt); amortization (loans dying through
scheduled payments); the credit-card trap (minimum payments
applied to principal AFTER interest); the same machine working
in both directions (your savings vs. your debt).

Apply to my system. Even systems that aren't directly
financial have money flowing through them.

1. **Identify three financial flows in the system.**
   Examples:
   - Transit: fare collection; capital costs and bond
     financing; subsidies.
   - Streaming: subscription revenue; content licensing
     costs; ad revenue (if applicable).
   - Sports: ticket sales; broadcast rights; player
     contracts.
   - Restaurant: food costs; labor; rent; revenue.
   - Hospital: patient billing; insurance reimbursement;
     equipment financing.

2. **Compute one interest calculation in the system.**
   Examples:
   - Capital project: city issues a $500M bond at 4.5%
     for 30 years. What is the annual debt service?
   - Subscription: streaming service holds $X in cash
     reserves earning 4%. What is annual interest income?
   - Restaurant: a small business loan of $200K at 7%
     for 7 years. What is the monthly payment?
   Use compound interest. Show the formula. Show the
   plug-in.

3. **Build an amortization schedule (first 6 periods)
   for one debt-like flow in the system.** Show: starting
   balance, payment, interest portion, principal portion,
   ending balance. Don't fake any numbers — derive them.

4. **Find a "credit card dynamic" in the system.** Many
   non-credit-card situations have the same structure:
   small payments mostly servicing accumulating fees /
   interest / overhead, with the principal barely moving.
   Examples: late-fee accumulation in city parking
   tickets; accruing interest on unpaid medical bills;
   library fines; vehicle-impound fees.
   - Identify one such dynamic in your system.
   - Compute how long it would take a typical user /
     customer / payer to dig out from a starting debt
     paying just the minimum.

5. **Compare the same machine in both directions.** Pick
   one financial decision the system implicitly forces
   (whether to buy a monthly pass; whether to subscribe
   yearly vs. monthly; whether to finance equipment vs.
   buy outright). Show the same compound-interest
   machinery working in both directions. Show what changes
   when you're the borrower vs. when you're the lender.

End with: a one-page "money audit" of the system. Three
financial flows. One interest calculation. One 6-period
amortization schedule. One credit-card-style dynamic. One
both-directions comparison.
```

**What this produces:** A financial audit revealing the time-value-of-money machinery operating in the system. Most systems are quietly running compound-interest calculations on someone — students often don't notice until they've seen the schedule on paper.

**Connection to previous chapters:** Builds on Ch 5 (algebraic solving of break-even equations) and Ch 3 (cycles often correspond to billing periods).

**Preview of next chapter:** Chapter 7 — apply probability to the system. What's the probability that a user / customer / patient encounters X? What's the expected value of the system's typical outcome? Where is the system implicitly running a casino on its users?
